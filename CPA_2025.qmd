::: {.notes}
Alcohol use disorder is a chronic condition with high relapse rates, substantial co-morbidity with mental and physical health issues, and increased mortality risk.

Initial treatments, including medication and evidence-based psychosocial interventions, are effective. Unfortunately, many individuals never receive treatment. And for those who do, a critical gap in care often emerges once initial treatment ends.

Continuing care, including on-going monitoring, adaptive support, and when necessary re-engagement with more intensive treatment, is the gold standard for chronic conditions, like diabetes and hypertension. Similarly, alcohol use treatment is most effective when provided over longer durations and with active efforts to keep patients engaged in their recovery.

## Alcohol Use Disorder

- Continuing care is lacking for alcohol use disorder

:::{.fragment}
- Risk factors are individualized, numerous, dynamic, and interactive
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Optimal supports to address risk factors vary across individuals and within an individual over time
:::

:::{.notes}
Yet, our current treatment system lacks the capacity for long-term clinician-delivered care, and instead the primary focus is on symptom stabilization and harm reduction. 

Without ongoing support, many individuals are left to navigate recovery alone, asking themselves: How can I best support my recovery today? Which tool in my toolkit fits what I need right now?

The challenge is that risk factors for relapse are highly individualized, dynamic, and interactive — making self-monitoring difficult. And the optimal supports needed to address these risks vary both across individuals and within an individual over time.

An algorithm-guided recovery monitoring and support system could help individuals monitor their current and future risk of lapse, or goal-inconsistent alcohol use, after initial treatment and adjust their lifestyle, behaviors and support accordingly.

Such a system could offer personalized, adaptive recommendations aligned with evidenced-based care and prompt individuals to engage with support at times of high risk. 

For example, individuals could receive daily messages about changes in their lapse risk, along with recommendations based on their key risk factors, like an urge-surfing recommendation for someone experiencing strong cravings.

Moreover, it would provide a scalable option for long-term monitoring, addressing the substantial unmet need for continuing care in alcohol use disorder treatment.

For such a system to exist, we need two things. 
One, the system must be able to collect a rich and densely sampled source (or sources) of risk-relevant data.

Two, the system must have access to a model that can predict alcohol use with high performance and have interpretable model inputs for support recommendations to be mapped onto.

## Machine Learning and Digital Data

::: {.fragment}
- High dimensional feature sets
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Non-linear and interactive relationships between features and lapse risk probability
:::

:::{.fragment}
- Interpretability of feature importance
:::

:::{.notes}

Advances in both smartphone sensing of digital data and machine learning now make this possible. Smartphone sensing approaches (e.g., ecological momentary assessment, geolocation tracking) allow for frequent, longitudinal measurement of key risk factors, necessary for temporally precise prediction of lapse risk.

Machine learning models, can handle high-dimensional feature sets and accomodate non-linear and interactive relationships between features and lapse risk probability. And methods from interpretable machine learning can be used to understand which features contribute most to a lapse prediction.

:::{.notes}
EMA may be one promising sensing method for lapse prediction.

It offers direct and frequent insight into subjective feelings and experiences that can be easily mapped onto modular forms of treatment like the relapse prevention model 

Furthermore, individuals with substance use disorders have found EMA to be acceptable for sustained measurement for up to a year with relatively high completion rates, suggesting that this method is feasible for long-term monitoring throughout recovery.

:::

## Study Goals

Use EMA to:

1. Predict <span style="color: #c5050c;">**immediate risk**</span> of a lapse back to alcohol use (i.e., in the next 24 hours)

:::{.fragment}
2. Predict <span style="color: #c5050c;">**future risk**</span> of a lapse back to alcohol use (i.e., in a 24 hour window 2 weeks from now)
:::

:::{.notes}
In this study our goal was to develop models that predict both immediate and future lapse risk to improve adaptive, tailored continuing care support.

To achieve this, we built two models using EMA data:

Our first model predicts immediate risk of a lapse back to alcohol use (anytime in the next 24 hours).

This model could be updated daily to provide individuals information about changes in their risk and make supportive recommendations for immediate action based on the top features. 

Earlier I gave the example of an urge surfing recommendation for someone with strong cravings. This could also include recommending a guided relaxation video when someone is reporting recent stressful events or offering encouragement when someone has gone a certain length of time without drinking.

Importantly, this assumes that the recommendations can be implemented immediately, likely in a smartphone app.

But the best clinical recommendation might not be able to be done immediately. Imagine trying to schedule a therapy appointment in the next 24 hours!

Therefore, we also fit a second model to predict future risk of a lapse back to alcohol use. For this model we shifted the 24 hour prediction window 2-weeks into the future. So essentially this model predicts the probability that someone will lapse in a 24 hour window two weeks from now.

These “time-lagged” predictions could give people advanced warning to implement supports not immediately available to them.

## Design

- 3-month longitudinal study
- Participants completed 4 surveys daily
    - Craving, arousal, valence 
    - Past stressful events, risky situations, pleasant events
    - Future stressful events, risky situations, efficacy
    - Alcohol use


::: {.notes}
Participants completed 4 daily surveys for up to three months

Each survey had 10 items that asked about 
The greatest intensity of craving, arousal, and valence since the last survey.  

Stressful events, risky situations and pleasant events encountered since their last survey

Future stressful events, risky situations and efficacy looking in the next week

And any alcohol use they had not yet reported.

- Outcome = lapse or no lapse
- XGBoost algorithm
- Grouped nested k-fold cross-validation



::: {.notes}
We used all 10 EMA items plus 7 demographic questions to engineer our features, which serve as the inputs to our model.   
Time and day of alcohol was used to generate our outcome labels of lapse or no lapse.  
Our statistical algorithm was XGBoost.   
We used grouped nested k-fold cross-validation as our resampling method to ensure our models were evaluated on new data from new individuals

the average age was 41 years.

All of our participants had a goal of abstinence which made it easier for us to identify discrete lapse onsets.

:::

:::{.notes}
Participants on average completed 3 of the 4 EMAs each day. Participants completed at least one EMA on 95.0% of days. 

The plot on the left shows the percentage of EMA completion looking at the full 4x daily protocol (in red) and completion of at least 1x daily EMA (in grey) over the number of weeks on study. We found participants on average were able to sustain high rates of EMA completion over the full three months.

Here is the distribution for the two week model. Median posterior probability for auroc was .84. 

The median difference in posterior probability for these two models was .06, and there was a 1.0 probability that the lagged model performed worse than the no lag model. However, auROCs of .8 and higher are generally considered to indicate good performance.

## Feature Importance


```{r}

```



:::{.notes}
We can use feature importance values to contextualize model performance. 


This plot shows on average, across all participants and all observations, how much each feature category contributes to the model's predictions.

On the y-axis Feature categories are ordered by their aggregate importance across the two models. The importance of each feature category on the x-axis is displayed separately by color for each model. 

The relative ordering of important features remained somewhat consistent across the two models. Past use, future efficacy, and craving were the top three features for both models. However on average features were less important for the two week model, consistent with its lower performance.

:::

## Feature Importance


```{r}

```


:::{.notes}

When it comes to making a personalized recommendation for a recovery activity or support, we want to know what feature category is most important for a specific individual on a specific day. In other words, What does this individual need right now?

This figure shows the range of all individual feature importance values across all people and all days.

This plot suggests that even feature categories with low average importance (e.g., past pleasant event) have a wide range of individual importance values, suggesting that for seem people at some moments these features are clinically important.

## Model Fairness

:::{.fragment}


```{r}
# use cow_plot with NULL placeholder
```

:::

:::{.notes}

In this study we also looked at how fair our models were for three dichotomized demographic groups with known disparities in access to substance use treatment and substance use outcomes – race and ethnicity (not White vs. non-Hispanic White), income (below poverty vs. above poverty), and sex at birth (female vs. male).

Our models performed  worse for participants who were not white and had an income below the federal poverty line. 

The largest contributing factor is likely the lack of diversity in our training data.

Even with our coarse dichotomous grouping of race we only had 20 participants in the not White group (compared to 131 in the White group). We also saw a similar pattern in our income groups (with 49 people in the below poverty group and 102 people in the above poverty group).

In just a moment I'm going to return to this issue and discuss what we are currently doing to address this.

:::

## Model Fairness

```{r}

```


:::{.notes}

We did however have equal representation of men and women, and we still saw differences in performance. We are not sure exactly why this is. We did choose our EMA items based on domain expertise and years of lapse and relapse risk research. It is possible that these constructs more precisely describe lapse risk factors for men than for women. This could mean that more research is needed to identify lapse risk factors for women (and other groups underrepresented in the literature more broadly).

:::

```


:::{.notes}
And we saw this pattern with the lagged model as well.
:::

## Conclusions

- We can achieve clinically meaningful performance up to 2 weeks out

:::{.fragment}
- Advanced notice for treatment supports that are not immediately available
:::

:::{.fragment}
- A more representative training sample is critical for developing fair models
:::

:::{.notes}
In conclusion, Our models performed exceptionally well with median posterior probabilities for auROCs of .84 - .90. This suggests we can achieve clinically meaningful performance up to two weeks out. 

Model performance did decrease when prediction windows were shifted further into the future. This is not surprising given what we know about prediction and alcohol lapse. Many important lapse risk factors are fluctuating processes that can change day-by-day, if not more frequently. So when looking 2-weeks out, features are less proximal to the start of the prediction window. Still, the benefit of advanced notice of lapse risk likely outweighs the cost to performance.

Finally, these models are not yet clinically implementable. The most notable flaw being the unfairness of model performance for non-majority groups.
:::

## Current Future Directions

- Improve our models by adding more diverse training data


:::{.notes}
This is the first thing we are working to address in current future directions.

We are in the process of collecting data from a more diverse sample of individuals with alcohol use disorder to improve our models. And we are optimistic about this.

In EMA models from our lab that predict opioid lapses we have found that an adequately diverse sample resulted in comparative performance across these same groups.

## Current Future Directions

- Optimize the delivery of risk-relevant feedback

::: {.notes}

Returning again to the idea that these models will be most effective embedded in a recovery monitoring and support system.  

One crucial step is to investigate how to communicate information from our model output to individuals. Our models give us predicted probabilities of a lapse. One option would be to create thresholds for what constitutes low, medium, or high risk and relay current and future risk information to the individual. 

Another option would be to anchor the predicted probability to the individual. For example, is their risk higher or lower compared to the previous week.

But another thing our model's give us are the most important features driving that lapse prediction. We could imagine contextualizing lapse risk by alerting individuals to the most important predictor of their risk or using domain expertise to provide specific recommendations for recovery engagement.

In a recently funded grant in our lab, we plan to look what combination of risk-relevant information lead to optimal engagement and clinical recovery outcomes. 
:::


## Current Future Directions

- Improve our models by adding more diverse training data

- Optimize the delivery of risk-relevant feedback

- Combine EMA with other digital data (e.g., geolocation)

:::{.notes}
Finally, we have begun to build models that combing EMA with data from other lower burden sensing methods, like geolocation and cellular communications. Including these types of digital data could increase the number of features for better personalization of support recommendations without increasing burden.
