Alcohol use disorder is a chronic disease, characterized by high relapse rates, frequent reentry into treatment, and an increased risk of mortality.

Continuing care, including ongoing monitoring and early re-intervention, has been well established as the gold standard for managing chronic health conditions such as diabetes, asthma, and HIV. 

Generally, we do not treat AUD very well. We have treatments that work, but few individuals receive them.  And those that do receive treatment often receive time-limited care focused on initial symptom reduction.

## Continuing Care

Barriers:

- Cost and insurance reimbursement issues
- Lack of collaborative provider teams
- Passive referral processes
- Geographic barriers 
- Patient dropout
- Changes in patients' clinical needs over time

To illustrate, of the almost 30 million US adults with an active AUD in 2022. It is estimated that about12% received any treatment.
We do not have data to know how many people receive long term support or continuing care after initial treatment, but given these numbers we can imagine it is much lower.

Substance use treatment has been shown to be most effective when care is prescribed over longer durations and involves active efforts to keep patients engaged. Yet, for reasons including cost and insurance reimbursement issues, lack of collaborative provider teams, passive referral processes, geographic barriers to accessing services, patient dropout, and changes in the patient’s clinical needs over time, most treatment is time-limited and aimed at acute substance use reduction and symptom stabilization. This leaves a large treatment gap when it comes to long-term continuing care for substance use disorders.

## Relapse Prevention

- Relapses can occur at any point in recovery
- Relapse is preceded by high-risk situations
- These situations differ between individuals and within an individual over time

:::{.notes}
Continuing care for relapse prevention is an important part of recovery.

Relapses can occur at any point, even after years of successful moderation or abstinence.

Although for some people, it may feel as if a relapse comes out of nowhere, we have an extant relapse prevention literature that suggests relapse is preceded by high-risk situations These include emotional or cognitive states (affect, craving), environmental contingencies (stressful events, or risky situations),  and physiological states (arousal).

Importantly, high-risk situations differ between individuals and within an individual over-time. In other words, different people will need different supports at different times.

Personalized risk monitoring could help patients adapt their lifestyles, behaviors, and supports to their changing needs.

But we don’t have the resources for long-term clinician care and long-term continuous self-monitoring is really hard!
:::


## Machine Learning and Digital Data

:::{.notes}
Imagine a smartphone app that could alert patients of changes in their relapse risk and make personalized recommendations based on top features contributing to their risk. Like an urge surfing recommendation for someone with strong cravings.

So How do we get here?

We need 2 things.

We need a rich and densely sampled source of risk-relevant data and 
we need accurate machine learning models that can both predict and contextualize relapse risk.

:::

## Recovery Monitoring and Support System


## Ecological Momentary Assessment


## Study Goals

Use EMA to:

1. Predict immediate lapses back to alcohol use (i.e., next 24 hours).

:::{.fragment}
2. Predict lapses occuring in a 24 hour window 2 weeks from now.
:::

:::{.notes}
Narrow prediction window widths like our next hour or next day model are well suited for addressing immediate risk. These models can be updated hourly or daily to provide individuals information about changes in their risk and make supportive recommendations based on the top features. 

This goes back to my early example about an urge surfing recommendation. This could also include recommending a guided relaxation video when someone is reporting recent stressful events or offering encouragement when someone has gone a certain length of time without drinking.

Importantly, this assumes that the recommendations can be implemented immediately, likely in a smartphone app.

But the best recommendation might not be able to be done immediately. Imagine trying to schedule a therapy appointment in the next hour!

Given that the next week model may not have sufficient temporal specificity to recommend immediate action. Its clinical utility could come from being able to shift this coarser window width into the future. In essence creating a “time-lagged” model that could provide people with increased lead time to implement supports not immediately available to them.

In this study I wanted to see if I could maintain clinically meaningful model performance as I shifted the 1 week window further into the future.

## Design

- 3-month longitudinal study
- Participants completed 4 surveys daily

:::{.fragment}
- 279 features
- Outcome = lapse or no lapse
- XGBoost algorithm
- Grouped nested k-fold cross-validation
:::


::: {.notes}
Participants completed 4 daily surveys for up to three months

They reported: 
The greatest intensity of craving, arousal, and valence since the last survey.  

Stressful events, risky situations and pleasant events encountered since their last survey

Future stressful events, risky situations and efficacy looking in the next week

And any alcohol use they had not yet reported.

We used all 10 EMA items plus 7 demographic questions to engineer our features. We had a total of 279 features. 
Time and day of alcohol use to generate our outcome labels of lapse or no lapse.
We considered a range of statistical algorithms, but XGBoost consistently emerged as our best model in validation sets so for evaluation we only considered XGBoost.
We used grouped nested k-fold cross-validation to ensure our models were evaluated on new data from new individuals

## Participants

## Adherence

## Model Performance


## Feature Importance


## Model Fairness


## Conclusions

- We can achieve clinically meaningful performance up to 2 weeks out
- Advanced notice for treatment supports that are not immediately available
- A more representative training sample is critical for developing fair models


## Next Steps

- Collecting data from a more diverse sample of individuals with alcohol use disorder to improve our models.

- In models that predict opioid lapses we have found that an adequately diverse sample resulted in comparative performance between groups

- show fairness fig from RISK2

## Next Steps

- Delivering risk-relevant feedback

- add chat bubbles

::: {.notes}

Returning again to the idea that these models will be most effective embedded in a recovery monitoring and support system. There are a few next steps we need to take. 

One crucial step is to investigate how to communicate information from our model output to individuals. Our models give us predicted probabilities of a lapse and the most important features driving that lapse prediction. In addition, we could imagine contextualizing this information further by determining whether someone’s predicted probability has increased or decreased in the last week or using domain expertise to provide specific recommendations for recovery engagement.  In a recently funded grant in our lab, we plan to look what combination of risk-relevant information leads to optimal engagement and clinical recovery outcomes. 

:::

## Next Steps

- Delivering risk-relevant feedback

- Predictions with longer lag times

:::{.notes}
In such a system, we can imagine that even longer lags (i.e., more advanced warning) could be helpful. In the present study, we were limited by how much time we could lag predictions. Participants only provided EMA for up to three months. Therefore, a lag time of two weeks between the prediction time point and start of the prediction window means data from 2 out of the 12 possible weeks is not being used. This loss of data could be one reason we saw a decrease in model performance with increased lag times. 
:::

## Next Steps

- Delivering risk-relevant feedback

- Predictions with longer lag times

- Combine EMA with other digital data (e.g., geolocation) to increase the number of model features for personalized recommendations.
