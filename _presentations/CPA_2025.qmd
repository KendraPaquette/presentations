Alcohol use disorder is a chronic disease, characterized by high relapse rates, frequent reentry into treatment, and an increased risk of mortality.

Continuing care, including ongoing monitoring and early re-intervention, has been well established as the gold standard for managing chronic health conditions such as diabetes, asthma, and HIV. 

Generally, we do not treat AUD very well. We have treatments that work, but few individuals receive them.  And those that do receive treatment often receive time-limited care focused on initial symptom reduction.

Barriers:

- Cost and insurance reimbursement issues
- Lack of collaborative provider teams
- Passive referral processes
- Geographic barriers 
- Patient dropout
- Changes in patients' clinical needs over time

::: {.notes}
To illustrate, of the almost 30 million US adults with an active AUD in 2022. It is estimated that about12% received any treatment.
We do not have data to know how many people receive long term support or continuing care after initial treatment, but given these numbers we can imagine it is much lower.

Substance use treatment has been shown to be most effective when care is prescribed over longer durations and involves active efforts to keep patients engaged. Yet, for reasons including cost and insurance reimbursement issues, lack of collaborative provider teams, passive referral processes, geographic barriers to accessing services, patient dropout, and changes in the patient’s clinical needs over time, most treatment is time-limited and aimed at acute substance use reduction and symptom stabilization. This leaves a large treatment gap when it comes to long-term continuing care for substance use disorders.

## Relapse Prevention

- Relapses can occur at any point in recovery

::: {.fragment}
- Risk factors are individualized, dynamic, and interactive
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Optimal supports to address risk factors vary across individuals and within an individual over time
:::

:::{.notes}
Continuing care for relapse prevention is an important part of recovery.

Relapses can occur at any point, even after years of successful moderation or abstinence.

The risk factors preceding relapse during recovery are individualized, numerous, dynamic, interactive, and non-linear.

Therefore, the optimal supports to address these risk factors vary both across individuals and within an individual over time. In other words, different people will need different supports at different times.

Personalized risk monitoring could help patients adapt their lifestyles, behaviors, and supports to their changing needs.

But we don’t have the resources for long-term clinician care and long-term continuous self-monitoring is really hard!

:::{.notes}
An algorithm-guided recovery monitoring and support system could help patients self-monitor their risk for relapse.

This system could provide a scalable option for low-cost, long-term monitoring; offer personalized, adaptive recommendations aligned with evidenced-based care; and prompt individuals to engage with support at times of high risk.

For example individuals could receive daily messages about changes in their relapse risk and receive personalized recommendations based on top features contributing to their risk. Like an urge surfing recommendation for someone with strong cravings.

For such a system to exist, we need two things. 
One, the system must be able to collect a rich and densely sampled source (or sources) of risk-relevant data.

Two, the system must have access to a model that can predict substance use with high performance and have interpretable model inputs for support recommendations to be mapped onto.

## Machine Learning and Digital Data

- High dimensional feature sets

::: {.fragment}
- Non-linear and interactive relationships between features and lapse risk probability
:::

:::{.fragment}
- Interpretability of feature importance
:::

:::{.notes}

Advances in both smartphone sensing of digital data and machine learning now make this possible. Smartphone sensing approaches (e.g., ecological momentary assessment [EMA], geolocation sensing) can provide the frequent, longitudinal measurement of proximal risk factors that is necessary for prediction of future lapses with high temporal precision.

Machine learning models can handle high dimensional feature sets from feature engineering densely sampled raw data over time. They can also accommodate non-linear and interactive relationships between features and lapse risk probability. Additionally, methods from interpretable machine learning can be used to understand which risk features contribute most strongly to a lapse prediction for a specific individual at a specific moment in time.

It offers direct and frequent insight into subjective feelings and experiences that can be easily mapped onto modular forms of treatment, such as the relapse prevention model 

Furthermore, individuals with SUDs have found EMA to be acceptable for sustained measurement for up to a year with relatively high compliance, suggesting that this method is feasible for long-term monitoring throughout SUD recovery.

:::

## Study Goals

Use EMA to:

1. Predict immediate lapses back to alcohol use (i.e., next 24 hours).

:::{.fragment}
2. Predict lapses occuring in a 24 hour window 2 weeks from now.
:::

:::{.notes}
Narrow prediction window widths like our next hour or next day model are well suited for addressing immediate risk. These models can be updated hourly or daily to provide individuals information about changes in their risk and make supportive recommendations based on the top features. 

This goes back to my early example about an urge surfing recommendation. This could also include recommending a guided relaxation video when someone is reporting recent stressful events or offering encouragement when someone has gone a certain length of time without drinking.

Importantly, this assumes that the recommendations can be implemented immediately, likely in a smartphone app.

But the best recommendation might not be able to be done immediately. Imagine trying to schedule a therapy appointment in the next hour!

Therefore, in this project we also shifted the 24 hour prediction window 2-weeks into the future. So essentially will someone lapse in a 24 hour window two weeks from now.

These “time-lagged” predictions could give people advanced warning to implement supports not immediately available to them.

## Design

- 3-month longitudinal study
- Participants completed 4 surveys daily
    - craving, arousal, valence, stressful events, risky situations, pleasant events, efficacy, alcohol use
    
:::{.fragment}
- 279 features
- Outcome = lapse or no lapse
- XGBoost algorithm
- Grouped nested k-fold cross-validation
:::


::: {.notes}
Participants completed 4 daily surveys for up to three months

Each survey had 10 items that asked about 
The greatest intensity of craving, arousal, and valence since the last survey.  

Stressful events, risky situations and pleasant events encountered since their last survey

Future stressful events, risky situations and efficacy looking in the next week

And any alcohol use they had not yet reported.

We used all 10 EMA items plus 7 demographic questions to engineer our features. We had a total of 279 features. 
Time and day of alcohol use to generate our outcome labels of lapse or no lapse.
We considered a range of statistical algorithms, but XGBoost consistently emerged as our best model in validation sets so for evaluation we only considered XGBoost.
We used grouped nested k-fold cross-validation to ensure our models were evaluated on new data from new individuals
:::

## Participants


:::{.notes}
We looked at the predictive utility of EMA for alcohol lapse prediction in a sample of 151 participants with moderate to severe alcohol use disorder in Madison, WI.

Additionally, all of our participants had a goal of abstinence which made it easier for us to identify discrete lapse onsets.

## Conclusions

- We can achieve clinically meaningful performance up to 2 weeks out

:::{.fragment}

:::

:::{.fragment}
- A more representative training sample is critical for developing fair models

## Current Future Directions

- Collecting data from a more diverse sample of individuals with alcohol use disorder to improve our models.

:::{.fragment}
- In models that predict opioid lapses we have found that an adequately diverse sample resulted in comparative performance between groups

Returning again to the idea that these models will be most effective embedded in a recovery monitoring and support system.  

One crucial step is to investigate how to communicate information from our model output to individuals. Our models give us predicted probabilities of a lapse. One option would be to create thresholds for what constitutes low, medium, or high risk and relay this information to the individual. It is quite possible though that this could have iatrogenic effects. For example, it could trigger an abstinence violation effect where the individual thinks well Im probably going to lapse anyway so why try.

Another option would be to anchor the predicted probability to the individual. For example, is their risk higher or lower compared to the previous week.

But another thing our model's give us are the most important features driving that lapse prediction. We could imagine contextualizing lapse risk by alerting individuals to the most important predictor of their risk or using domain expertise to provide specific recommendations for recovery engagement. In a recently funded grant in our lab, we plan to look what combination of these risk-relevant information lead to optimal engagement and clinical recovery outcomes. =

## Current Future Directions

- Delivering risk-relevant feedback

- Predictions with longer lag times

![](https://github.com/KendraPaquette/presentations/blob/main/images/plan.png?raw=true)


:::{.notes}
In such a system, we can imagine that even longer lags (i.e., more advanced warning) could be helpful. In the present study, we were limited by how much time we could lag predictions. Participants only provided EMA for up to three months. Therefore, a lag time of two weeks between the prediction time point and start of the prediction window means data from 2 out of the 12 possible weeks is not being used. This loss of data could be one reason we saw a decrease in model performance with increased lag times. 
:::

## Current Future Directions

- Delivering risk-relevant feedback

- Predictions with longer lag times

- Combine EMA with other digital data (e.g., geolocation) to increase the number of model features for personalized recommendations.

:::{.notes}
A recovery monitoring and support system will require new data to update model predictions. A model only using EMA could raise measurement burden concerns. Research suggests people can comply with effortful sensing methods (e.g., 4x daily EMA) while using substances but still we can imagine this could be quite burdensome.

We have begun to explore how we can supplement our models with data from other lower burden sensing methods. For example, geolocation is a passive sensing method that could compliment EMA well. 

Additionally adding more data sources gives us more features and that could mean better personalization of predictions and recommendations for more people
